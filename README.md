# K-Weather

K-Weather is a machine learning app that uses KNN regression models to predict tomorrow's high, low, and pressure. The site uses you ip address to find your location, then pull the last 4 days of weather data. This weather data is then used by our model to make predictions.

Our models achieved acceptable R^2 values for each of our models. Our model to predict highs scored .81, our model to predict lows scored .85, and our model for pressure achieved .96.
