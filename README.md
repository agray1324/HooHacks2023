# K-Weather

K-Weather is an innovative weather prediction app developed during a 24-hour hackathon, which employs KNN regression models to estimate tomorrow's high and low temperatures, as well as atmospheric pressure. This project showcases the potential of using machine learning techniques in weather forecasting applications.

The system automatically detects your geographical location using your IP address, providing you with personalized and location-specific forecasts. K-Weather retrieves and analyzes the past four days of meteorological data from your area and integrates this information into our prediction models.

While our models may not outperform traditional forecasting methods, they demonstrate the feasibility of applying machine learning to this field. Our high-temperature prediction model achieved an R^2 value of 0.81, the low-temperature model scored 0.85, and our atmospheric pressure prediction model scored 0.96.
